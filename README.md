<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a first semester interdisciplinary project, for PUC Minas Jogos Digitais. It is a video game built with Unity, using assets and code created by myself, unless otherwise noted. Tank-Wrecks is a fast-paced arcade game based on tank battles, where you face infinite waves of increasingly while colleting ammo, health and other powerups. You will control a single tank, and explore multiple levels as you do so.

### Built With
Tank Wrecks and its assets were built using the following software:
* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
* [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)
* [Articy Draft](https://www.articy.com/en/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To download a working build of Tank Wrecks is simple; first check if your computer is running one of the supported OS and meets the requirements for CPU and GPU capabilities. Then, you need only download the latest release, unzip the folder and execute Tank Wrecks.exe. If you have any problems installing the game, feel free to open an issue or contact me at paulo at ninito.me for support.

### Minimum Requirements

You will need a working machine running:
* Windows 7 (SP1+) or later;
* Ubuntu 16.04 or later;
* Sierra 10.12+ or later;
* DX10 or later capable graphics card;
* A x86 or x64 architecture cpu

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How To Play

In Tank Wrecks, you control a tank seen from a third-person perspective. You can control the tank's movement using the WASD keys, and the tank's cannon using the arrow keys. You can fire the cannon using spacebar. You must display dexterity and strategic awareness, on top of a strong kinesthetic sense. Your goal is to accrue as many points as you can; destroying enemy waves, collecting powerups and surviving!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

The game is scheduled to enter Alpha in september 17, where the game will be at an early but functional stage at this point. Core features will be implemented, but may lack polish and content. Later, in october 17, the game will enter Beta, where most features will have seen considerable amounts of polish, and most content will have been implemented. Lastly, in november 18, the game will go gold, where it will be feature-complete and content-complete. Most bugs will have been ironed out, and it is unlikely the game will recieve further support past this point.
